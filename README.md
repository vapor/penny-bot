### Automatic Releases

Penny detects usage of specific labels in PRs and tries to act accordingly and automatically tag a new release when an applicable PR is merged.

The related labels are:
* `semver-patch`
* `semver-minor`
* `semver-major`
* `semver-noop`
* `release`
* `prerelease`
* `no-release-needed`

Some other notes:
* `semver-major` and `release` are of limited use for automatic releases. Penny won't do a whole major release by itself since those are rare and they can be risky to do.
* Use `prerelease` label in combination with another semver label like `semver-patch` to make sure Penny can correctly create a prerelease, when a prerelease is needed.
  * For example when you have a `v5.0.0-alpha.1` release and want Penny to tag `v5.0.0-alpha.2` next.
* Try to use `no-release-needed` or `semver-noop` when no release is needed.
