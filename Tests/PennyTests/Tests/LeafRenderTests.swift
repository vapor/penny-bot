            ## Auto-Pings Help

            You can add texts to be pinged for.
            When someone uses those texts, Penny will DM you about the message.

            - Penny can't DM you about messages in channels which Penny doesn't have access to (such as the role-related channels)

            > All auto-pings commands are ||private||, meaning they are visible to you and you only, and won't even trigger the <a:is_typing:1087429908466253984> indicator.

            ### Adding Expressions

            You can add multiple texts using </auto-pings add:1>, separating the texts using commas (`,`). This command is Slack-compatible so you can copy-paste your Slack keywords to it.

            - Using 'mode' argument You can configure penny to look for exact matches or plain containment. Defaults to 'Containment'.

            - All texts are **case-insensitive** (e.g. `a` == `A`), **diacritic-insensitive** (e.g. `a` == `Ã¡` == `Ã£`) and also **punctuation-insensitive**. Some examples of punctuations are: `â€œ!?-_/\(){}`.

            - All texts are **space-sensitive**.

            > Make sure Penny is able to DM you. You can enable direct messages for Vapor server members under your Server Settings.

            ### Removing Expressions

            You can remove multiple texts using </auto-pings remove:1>, separating the texts using commas (`,`).

            ### Your Pings List

            You can use </auto-pings list:1> to see your current expressions.

            ### Testing Expressions

            You can use </auto-pings test:1> to test if a message triggers some expressions.
